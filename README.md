If you want to build a large npm project into a sub folder `dist/`, but then treat that as the root directory for the published package, you will need to copy all other special files npm includes in the publish. Let `npm-publish-files` do that for you!

### Setup

This script will make sure all necessary files are copied to `dist/` before running `npm publish`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "prepublishOnly": "npm-publish-files --force dist"
  }
}
```

Any additional files specified in the ["file" property of package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#files) will also be copied.

After this your are free to run `npm publish dist`.

## Files Copied

`npm-publish-files` uses the [npm-packlist](https://github.com/npm/npm-packlist) package under the hood to determine which files to copy. Please read its readme to better understand the algorhithm.

To copy additional files, supply one or more globs with the `--include` option. All matched files will be copied to `<dir>`.

To exclude files from being copied, supply one or more globs with the `--exclude` option. These will be applied last, so they filter both the default files, as well as those matched via the `--include` option.
